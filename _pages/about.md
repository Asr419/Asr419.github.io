My name is Aayush Singha Roy and I'm currently pursuing a PhD at the [University College of Dublin](https://www.ucd.ie/) where I am specializing in the field of A.I. with a focus on session based slate recommender systems algorithms.

I'm a member of the [Insight Centre for Data Analytics](https://www.insight-centre.org/) and I'm currently working under the supervision of  [Prof. Neil Hurley](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=Xy75cgsW65QC&hl=en&oi=ao). I recently finished my Summer Internship 2024 at Adobe India with Media Data Science Research (MDSR) Lab.
